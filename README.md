# Islandfox.dev

This is my personal website, hosted on Cloudflare pages at https://islandfox.dev . It's written in React, with Material UI components and styling.
It was made as a challenge for myself, to see how good of a website I could make in only 12 hours. Since then I've added additional improvements, but I'm very happy with how it came out in the 12 hours.
